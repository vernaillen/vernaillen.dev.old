Besides my passion for web development (which is the main focus of this website), I do have another big passion: Sound & Music.

I'm following a [Sound Healing training](https://www.akasharetreatcenter.com/soundhealing-training), I have some fun with music production as well as [web audio](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#introductory) programming, and recently I played my very first [Ecstatic Dance dj-set](https://www.mixcloud.com/woutervernaillen/rebirth-ecstatic-dance-krimpvarkie-huisi/).

## Music + Web development

On this website you can see the love for sound & music and the interest in web development coming together:

* added one of my jams as an mp3 on this website, added [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) and [audioMotion-analyzer](https://audiomotion.dev/).<br />Hit play below to hear and see the result:

    <player-controls extended />

* created [vue-audiomotion-analyzer](https://vue-audiomotion-analyzer.dev/), a Vue plugin to wrap the [audioMotion-analyzer](https://audiomotion.dev/)
* learned Pinia to control the state of the Tone.player, so the play/pause button is updated automatically in all 3 locations (header, footer and this page)

## Modular

This past year I also started builing a Eurorack modular synthesizer. For the case I decided to go for a [Erica Synths 2x104HP Carbon Fiber Travel Case](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/enclosures/carbon/2x104hp-carbon-fiber-travel-case-lid/) and already bought a few modules :D

You can find some videos of jams on my [RackNomad Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/racknomad/) or [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmlPhwe54sHvnK_HOL_-SlA)
