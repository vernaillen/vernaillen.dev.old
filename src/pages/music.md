Besides my passion for web development (which is the main focus of this website), I do have another big passion: Sound & Music.

I'm following a [Sound Healing training](https://www.akasharetreatcenter.com/soundhealing-training), I have some fun with music production as well as [web audio](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#introductory) programming, and recently I played my very first [Ecstatic Dance dj-set](https://www.mixcloud.com/woutervernaillen/rebirth-ecstatic-dance-krimpvarkie-huisi/).

I played around with my [Moog Subharmonicon](<https://www.moogmusic.com/products/subharmonicon>) & [Mother 32](<https://www.moogmusic.com/products/mother-32>), [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/), [Arturia Mini V](https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/mini-v/overview) and [VCV Rack 2](https://vcvrack.com/), created some test tracks and uploaded them to [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/woutervernaillen).

On this website you can see the love for sound & music and the interest in web development coming together.

* Upon hitting Play (which will be enabled once the buffer is ready):
  * Audio is started, progress is shown on the waveform and the audioMotion Analyzer shows the audio spectrum

  <player-controls extended />

* It was fun creating a Vue plugin to wrap the audioMotion Analyzer, as well as learning Pinia to control the state of the Tone.player, so the play/pause button is updated automatically in all 3 locations (header, footer and this page)

* Meanwhile I also started builing a Eurorack modular synthesizer. For the case I decided to go for a [Erica Synths 2x104HP Carbon Fiber Travel Case](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/enclosures/carbon/2x104hp-carbon-fiber-travel-case-lid/).
Some modules I got so far: the [Instruo Arbhar](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/arbhar/), [Make Noise Morhaphene](https://makenoisemusic.com/modules/morphagene) & [Maths](https://makenoisemusic.com/modules/maths), [QU-Bit Bloom](https://www.qubitelectronix.com/shop/bloom), [Mutable Instruments Marbles](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/marbles/), [Rings](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/rings/) & [Plaits](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/plaits/), [Noise Engineering Basimilus Iteratus Alter](https://noiseengineering.us/products/basimilus-iteritas-alter).
And an [Expert Sleepers ES-9](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/es9.html) provides connectivity with [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) and [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/).

You can find some videos of jams on my [RackNomad Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/racknomad/) or [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmlPhwe54sHvnK_HOL_-SlA)
