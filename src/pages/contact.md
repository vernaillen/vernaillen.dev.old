I decided not to put a contact form on my website any more, cause fighting spam is not one of favourite hobbies.

For the headhunters, I do like to hear from you if you got an extremely interesting opportunity.
But in order to keep my flow and focus for my current client, I prefer to do any initial contacts asynchronously.  ;)

Feel free to leave me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woutervernaillen/) or any other social platform:
