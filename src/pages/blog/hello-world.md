## Sunset of Vernaillen.com

To be honest the most important reason why I wanted to make a new website is because [Vernaillen.com](https://www.vernaillen.com) was made in Liferay and I didn't want to keep a Liferay server running only for my personal website. It's definitely overkill.
And besides that, my main focus as a freelance consultant is not on Liferay any more lately, but more on full stack development with Spring micro-services, Angular or Vue.js, as well as on DevOps with Kubernetes, Jenkins, Sonar, etc.

## Hello World for Vernaillen.dev

Since I wanted to become more skilled in Vue.js anyway, I decided to rewrite my website using Vue 3, Vite, Tailwind and Markdown.

For the design I decided to use this [Startup Tailwind CSS Template](https://tailwindtemplates.co/templates/startup), cause I'm a developer, not a designer :D
It was fun to port into the Vue app. And after changing the main colors to match my company branding and logo (design by my sister, [Anneleen Vernaillen](https://www.anneleenvernaillen.com)), I thought the result was quite nice.

The fun for me is in learning the new features of Vue 3, learning how to use Vite and Tailwind, and most of all create functionality blog system based on simple markdown files.
As well as setting up continuous integration with CircleCI & code checks with SonarCloud. I'm also testing 2 app hosting platforms, Netlify & Vercel.
