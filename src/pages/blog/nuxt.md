While this site [vernaillen.dev](https://vernaillen.dev) is still made from scratch up with Vue, for which I spend a lot of time selecting and integrating different vue and vite plugins, I decided to migrate (or upgrade) [Harmonics.be](https://harmonics.be) and [links.wouter.net](https://links.wouter.net) to [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/).

Nuxt makes it a lot easier and faster to bootstrap a new website. Less fiddling with plugins to make it all work nicely together. 
And it's bundled with Vite and running on Nitro's server engine, so it's pretty fast :)

At the moment I'm building a new website for my sister with Nuxt, and then next I will migrate this website, [vernaillen.dev](https://vernaillen.dev) as well.

## Learning Nuxt

For learning Nuxt I decided to go for the [Mastering Nuxt 3](https://masteringnuxt.com/) video course, which is created by the team who created Nuxt 3. I didn't regret that purchase and I can highly recommed it.

I have to be honest though, I haven't worked my way through all the chapters yet, as I already started building and learning Nuxt hands on. As I usually do. ;)
