To be honest the most important reason why I wanted to make a new website is because the old one was made in Liferay and I didn't want to keep a Liferay server running only for my personal website. It's overkill.
And I'm actually focusing less on Liferay these days, but more on pure stack development with Spring micro-services and Angular or Vue.js.

And since I wanted to become more skilled in Vue.js anyway, so I decided to rewrite my website using Vue 3, Vite, Tailwind and Markdown.

For the design I decided to use this [Tailwind CSS Template](https://tailwindtemplates.co/templates/startup), cause I'm a developer, not a designer :D

The fun for me is in learning the new features of Vue 3, learning how to use Vite and Tailwind, and most of all create functionality blog system based on simple markdown files.
As well as setting up continuous integration with CircleCI & code checks with SonarCloud. I'm also testing 2 app hosting platforms, Netlify & Vercel.

## Vue & Vite

## Markdown & FrontMatter

## Tailwind
