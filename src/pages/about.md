I'm an avid traveler, following the sunshine around the world, always open to learn from other cultures and intrigued by cross-cultural movements and tribes.

[Sound and music](/music) is one of my passions, it's a way for me to translate, give and recieve energy. I'm currently following a training as sound healing facilitator.

## Career

My career as an IT consultant started in 1999. The first 14 years I worked as an employee for several IT service companies, and since 2013 I'm working as a freelancer.

I have strongly specialised in full stack java development on portal platforms.
Since 2006 this was focussed on IBM WebSphere Portal, as I was working for IBM.
Later, when I decided to start freelancing, I changed my focus to open source and [Liferay Portal](https://www.liferay.com/).
