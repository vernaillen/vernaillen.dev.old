## Kubernetes
For a project I'm doing on Liferay for a customer I decided to deploy Liferay on a [managed Kubernetes cluster at DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/)

### Why Kubernetes?
 - I need to learn all about, as we're also using it at my biggest client. (They have a private cloud though, for this smaller project I need a public cloud)
 - For local development I was already using ([Liferay's official](https://hub.docker.com/u/liferay)) docker images
 - Kubernetes does seem to become the de facto standard for orchestrating docker
 - Since [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) has OOTB support for [Kubernetes](https://www.docker.com/products/kubernetes) it became very easy to setup and test the environment locally first

### Why DigitalOcean?
 -

## Getting started
 - create Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean
 - download config file
 - check connectivity
```shell script
k8s-liferay$ kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   9d
kube-node-lease   Active   9d
kube-public       Active   9d
kube-system       Active   9d
```

## Helm
Installed helm with homebrew and added the official Helm stable charts repo.
``` shell script
k8s-liferay$ brew install helm
k8s-liferay$ helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
k8s-liferay$ helm repo update
```
You can read more about it on the [Helm quickstart page](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)

``` shell script
k8s-liferay$ helm create liferay
```
