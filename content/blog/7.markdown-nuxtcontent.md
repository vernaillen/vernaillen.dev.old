title: Markdown & Nuxt Content
---

I wanted ease to maintain my blog. Don't need a database if you can just use markdown files

First I used markdown-plugin, pages, ssg, etc
But I had a hard time to integrate i18n with that structure. I got it working in the end, but it wasn't ideal.

And then I discovered Nuxt Content


simple-git

VS Code is an excellent markdown editor
Publishing content -> git commit & push
GitHub is my content magement system.

Created date and published date are fetched from the github commit history using simple-git
