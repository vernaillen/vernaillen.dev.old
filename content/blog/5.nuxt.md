After rebuilding this site [vernaillen.dev](https://vernaillen.dev) from scratch up with Vue [last year](/blog/hello-world-vernaillen-dev), for which I spend a lot of time selecting and integrating different vue and vite plugins, I decided to build my other website, [Harmonics.be](https://harmonics.be) and [links.vernaillen.com](https://links.vernaillen.com) with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/).

Nuxt makes it a lot easier and faster to bootstrap a new website. Less fiddling with plugins to make it all work nicely together. 
And it's bundled with Vite and running on Nitro's server engine, so it's pretty fast.
I also love writing and publishing content with Markdown, therefor [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) is just perfect for me for content management.

*Edit: A month has past since I've first published this blog post, but since then I've also created a new website using Nuxt for my sister [Anneleen Vernaillen](https://www.anneleenvernaillen.com/), and today (March 2) I've put the Nuxt version of [this website](https://vernaillen.dev) online.*

## The learning never stops

For learning everything about Nuxt I decided to purchase the [Mastering Nuxt 3](https://masteringnuxt.com/) video course, which is created by the team who created Nuxt 3. I didn't regret that purchase and I can highly recommed it.

Currently I'm learning how to build and secure serverside api's with Nuxt.
