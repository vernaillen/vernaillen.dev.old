While this site [vernaillen.dev](https://vernaillen.dev) is still made from scratch up with Vue, for which I spend a lot of time selecting and integrating different vue and vite plugins, I decided to migrate (or upgrade) [Harmonics.be](https://harmonics.be) and [links.vernaillen.com](https://links.vernaillen.com) to [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/).

*Edit (March 2): Today I've also re-launched [vernaillen.dev](https://vernaillen.dev) with Nuxt :)* 

Nuxt makes it a lot easier and faster to bootstrap a new website. Less fiddling with plugins to make it all work nicely together. 
And it's bundled with Vite and running on Nitro's server engine, so it's pretty fast

At the moment I'm working on a [new website for Anneleen Vernaillen](https://www.anneleenvernaillen.com/) with Nuxt, and I've just this website, [vernaillen.dev](https://vernaillen.dev) as well.

## Websites developed with Nuxt so far

## Still learning more

For learning Nuxt I decided to go for the [Mastering Nuxt 3](https://masteringnuxt.com/) video course, which is created by the team who created Nuxt 3. I didn't regret that purchase and I can highly recommed it.

I have to be honest though, I haven't worked my way through all the chapters yet, as I already started building and learning Nuxt hands on. As I usually do. ;)
